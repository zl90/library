This project was created for the [Library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it by adding mobile responsiveness and a clean UI.
